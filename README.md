# SessionStorage_FactCollector

Hello world!! This project, is a _fact collector_, but what does this mean, you might wonder? well, the explanation, is that every fact, interrogant or question, has an answer. The answer sometimes is not clear, but for those that are clear, this app allows you to save a question-response pair in a very straight forward way, taking advantage of the key-value **_sessionstorage_** format. The data saved, is display at the same time in the browser, for the future consuption of the user. It's functionality is developed with plain **Vanilla JavaScript**, using _arrow functions_ to control its functionality.

The _Styling_ was developed with **CSS**, and it's developed with a light theme (white and blue) that resemble knowledge.

The implementation of **_SessionStorage_** over **_LocalStorage_**, was decided to not compromise permanent use of memory in your local machine, in case clearing the data is not executed.

## Current Functionality

- Store data in the browser **_SessionStorage_**, where the question is saved as the **_key_**, and the answer to that question is saved as the **_value_**.
- Display the data stored in the **_SessionStorage_** in the browser, as a list of question-answer pair.
- Clear the data stored in the **_SessionStorage_**, and the displayed list of question-answer aswell.

## Future Functionality to Implement

- Improve the design, to make more responsible.
- Store the data as objects, to save more info about it, such as subject and relevance of the fact/question saved.
